    <p class="col-span-3 md:col-span-2  font-light">Hello! I'm <strong>Hildana Bekele</strong>, a passionate photographer and a dedicated mother. While being a mom keeps me on my toes, photography has always held a special place in my heart. I believe that every moment, no matter how small, deserves to be cherished and remembered. <br><br><br> As a photographer, I've honed my skills through years of practice and a deep love for the art. While photography started as a hobby, it has blossomed into a fulfilling side gig that allows me to express my creativity and capture the beauty of the world around me.</p>
